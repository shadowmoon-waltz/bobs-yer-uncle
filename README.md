==============

Contains my patches and small projects that don't currently have a repository of their own (look at items to find out what license they're under; if unspecified, they are GPLv3).

* [Plex Download Button userscript](plex_dbl_btn.user.js) (plex_dbl_btn.user.js) - adds download button (individual videos) and copy curl download command(s) to clipboard (individual videos and seasons) button to plex (GPLv3 licensed; read javascript header for projects derived from and other details); install from the "Raw" button link if you want your userscript editor to keep it automatically updated (if you enabled that setting)
